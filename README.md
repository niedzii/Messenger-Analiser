# Messenger Analiser
Simple application to analise data from Facebook json messenger. 

Since facebook deleted option to see how many messages are in a conversation i came up with an idea to do it.
Facebook lets you download your data from their server. Messages as well.
You want to go to settings on facebook as shown :

And here you want to select messenger data and choose format to JSON :

It will take some time for facebook to prepare your data. It will notify you when it's ready and you can download it as .zip.
When it's downloaded just extract json file and paste its path into the main class and run.
It will show you informations like
- Name of conversation
- Participants
- Number of all messages
- Time and content (if available) of first message
- How many days ago it was and calculate avarage number of messages per day
- Display number of messages sent by each user
